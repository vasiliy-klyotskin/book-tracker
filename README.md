# Book Tracker

This repository is dedicated to tracking the progress of books I'm reading, have read, and plan to read. The focus is primarily on programming and mathematics books. The books are not just read but carefully worked through.

## Structure

This repository contains two main categories: **programming** and **mathematics**. Each category has the following subdirectories:

- **read/**: Books that I have finished working through.
- **in-progress/**: Books that I am currently working through.
- **to-read/**: Books that I plan to work through in the future.
